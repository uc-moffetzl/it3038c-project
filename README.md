# it3038c-project
This project will be about displaying the free space and capacity of your hard drive and display percentages of what folders are taking up the most space. (This is subject to change because I want to make a smart mirror)

To run this project, simply download the PowerShell file and run it

The output of the file displays the Hard Drive letter, capacity, Free Space(GB), Free Space(%), and Hard Drive type.

For Hard Drive types, here are what the hard drive numbers mean:

2 = "Removable disk"

3 = "Fixed local disk"

4 = "Network disk"

5 = "Compact disk"
